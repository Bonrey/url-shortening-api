## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

### Site URL

- [Live Site URL](https://url-shortening-api-lime.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- React JS
- React libraries
  - styled-components
  - Framer Motion
  - React Reveal
- [Shrtcode API](https://shrtco.de/)

### What I learned

It was definitely a fun challenge! I deepened my understanding of Framer Motion library and also got to grips with a URL shortening API. Also, I entertained myself with React Reveal library, which helps you create animations on scroll. It's not perfect but definitely worth checking out, in my opinion! ðŸ™‚
